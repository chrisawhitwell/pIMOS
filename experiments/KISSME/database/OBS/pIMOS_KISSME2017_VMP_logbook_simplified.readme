This log was created in archiving, to sipmlify the mess of VMP logs we had before. Previous logs had a lot more info per cast etc. This tracks much less info, and has only one row per file. In a more characteristic pIMOS style. 

Note also there are some files in the filder that are not in this log. As they are unlogged they won't be processed. 

Files prior to 5 are assumed tests. Files on the 4th [014 and 015] were during CSIRO CTD work, and not a real UWA targfet.
